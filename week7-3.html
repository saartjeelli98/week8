        <p class="about">Hi, I'm Sara!
            <br><br>
            I am a painter currently residing in Missoula, Montana. 
            My main focus is on documenting experiences, stories,
             and places through my art. I enjoy working with a variety 
             of media including colored pencils, paint media like 
             gouache and oil paint, and digital platforms. 
             <br><br>
            Don't hesitate to reach out for commissions or collaborations!
